A game developed in C++ in order to increase knowledge of the language and practise and learn techniques used in game development.

Following an online tutorial, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRUYl6_5m3o&index=1&list=PL93bFkoCMJslJJb15oQddnmABNUl6iz8e).

This is NOT original code, and I do not claim ownership of the idea, nor the code itself.

I intend to use this as a platform which I can base my own projects on in the future, when I have more experience with C++.
